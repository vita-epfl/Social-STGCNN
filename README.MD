<br />

This is code for **Social-STGCNN** editted for evaluation on the ETH-UCY split sampled according to TrajNet++ procedure and TrajNet++ benchmark.

TrajNet++ sampling allows to focus on pedestrians of interest that undergo social interactions, while ignoring non-essential trajectories like static trajectories.

## Scripts

Refer to Makefile for training and evaluation scripts.
